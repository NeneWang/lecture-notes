# Syllabus

This are some notes from my college courses. As I started this project I acknowledge that I am behind in the sense that I am writting this docs while coursing throught my courses. I am starting this project since last semester studying Compter Science @ CUNY Brooklyn College. But Plan to slowly recover the content from the previous courses.

Common Strategies:

- Developing Simulations and Modelings
  - Can Inspire by playing a Steam Game and inspiring a development of it.
