The National Liberation Front and the Algerians seemed to have agendas with some of the sentiments growing in the Algerians. This includes mainly the sentiment with the muslim  population of Algerians. They dont fully are one, but they do recruit from the muslim algerian populations, as shown on the recruiting example where an Algerian is inducted by doing a task. They are also very cautious in the way they organize and recruit as they are a clandestine organization challanging the population.

The clandestine nature of the FLN is secretive organizational structure, where each member is purportedly acquainted with only three others, shrouding its operations in mystery. And by not knowing who belongs to the organization aside of other 3 members. This secrecy underscores the gravity of their mission and the risks inherent in challenging colonial rule. Moreover, the FLN's efforts appear to show some efforts aimed at exerting control over Algerian public life, reflecting a desire to shape societal norms such as limiting prostitution, drugs as per religion and and resist the imposition of colonial values.

One of the most continuous aspects of the FLN's strategy is its willingness to target European civilians. While some may view such actions as necessary in the pursuit of liberation, and claim against being treated as second class citizens. I personally find them morally reprehensible but I understand that they must have felt treated horrible, and having their universal rights being violated time and time again. I am grateful, that the film tries to have a portrayal of these events in a semi-objective manner highlights.

The Battle of Algiers offers a stark portrayal of the escalating violence and its impact on both sides of the conflict. The ambiguity surrounding the perpetrators of certain attacks, reminiscent of the tactics employed before the rise of Hitler to germany, where communist attacks were used as excuses for more fascist policies, underscores the chaotic and ever scalating nature of urban warfare until one side gives out. The French military's response, marked by brutal tactics such as torture and indiscriminate violence, reflects a desperate attempt to quell resistance at any cost.

The French Army's tactics in the Casbah, while initially effective in the short term, ultimately contributed to France's downfall in Algeria. The reliance on brute force and the abuse of universal civil liberties alienated the Algerian population, fueling resentment and bolstering support for the FLN. As the conflict escalated, so too did the severity of the tactics employed by both sides, leading to a cycle of violence and radicalization. I would argue however that this might not be the only factor to the eventual loss of Algeria. It might also be that the FLN were but a symptom of a larger public discontent as a cause. However the movie doesn't has that scope of the situation. And the 

While driven by on each side, their reasons of noble or duty-wise reasonable aspirations, the insurange and counter-insurgance display shows but a side of the conflict. Likewise, the French military's heavy-handed tactics, while initially successful, ultimately proved unsustainable in long run. In my opionion because the FLN were but a symptom to a major unsustainable French colonial policy.
