While they don't have a one-to-one relationship with the interests of this demographic, they do recruit from it, as illustrated by instances where Algerians are enlisted after completing tasks. Their organizational and recruitment strategies are marked by caution due to their clandestine nature, which poses a challenge to the population.

The FLN's clandestine structure operates with a high degree of secrecy, where each member purportedly knows only three others, thus obscuring its operations. This secrecy emphasizes the gravity of their mission and the risks involved in challenging colonial rule. Moreover, the FLN appears to exert efforts to influence Algerian public life, including attempts to shape societal norms by addressing issues such as limiting prostitution and drug use in accordance with religious principles, while resisting the imposition of colonial values.

A consistent aspect of the FLN's strategy is its willingness to target European civilians. While some may justify such actions as necessary for liberation and protest against being treated as second-class citizens, I personally find them morally reprehensible. However, I acknowledge the profound sense of mistreatment and violation of universal rights that may have motivated these actions. I appreciate the film's attempt to portray these events in a somewhat objective manner.

"The Battle of Algiers" vividly depicts the escalating violence and its impact on both sides of the conflict. The ambiguity surrounding the perpetrators of certain attacks underscores the chaotic and ever-escalating nature of urban warfare. The French military's response, characterized by brutal tactics such as torture and indiscriminate violence, reflects a desperate attempt to quell resistance at any cost.

The French Army's tactics in the Casbah, while initially effective, ultimately contributed to France's downfall in Algeria. Relying on brute force and violating civil liberties alienated the Algerian population, fueling resentment and bolstering support for the FLN. As the conflict intensified, so did the severity of tactics employed by both sides, leading to a cycle of violence and radicalization. While this may not be the sole factor in Algeria's eventual loss, the FLN can be seen as a symptom of broader public discontent. A key conversation at timestamp 1:08:00 between Ali La Pointe and Ben-Mhindi addresses the notion that bloodshed and arms alone don't win wars, hinting at the deeper challenges faced after victory. This dialogue serves as a prelude to the eventual failure of the French colonial policy, despite their military success against the NLF insurgency.

While both sides were driven by noble or duty-bound aspirations, the insurgency and counter-insurgency display only one facet of the conflict. Similarly, the French military's heavy-handed tactics, while initially successful, proved unsustainable in the long run. In my opinion, the emergence of the FLN was symptomatic of a fundamentally flawed French colonial policy.
