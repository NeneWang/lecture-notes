What connects the wars of the 1930s and 1940s to the period of “decolonization?”

Between the wars of the 1930s and 1940s the period of decolonization were connected through the narrative in which the grip of the colonial empires were being loosen as the theaters of the second world war have shown the colonies that the empires were not as all-powerful as they were previously perceived. As the war developed, it became so evident that almost all American and European colonies were becoming independent. This can be seen from how Britain lost grip of it's colonies in Asia and Africa similar to the French.

How do surviving African veterans of the British army recall their service in World War II?

Surviving African veterans of the British army like recall their service in a brutal and sad experiences during World War II. For many, their service was marked by brutality, both physical and psychological, leaving indelible scars.  And even after the war they were sent back with an unceremonious unthankful way: "Vicious battlegrounds in Myanmar. After the war, he was repatriated not to Kenya but instead to the Somali region of Ethiopia – with no means to get home." (Losh) Testimonies from these veterans paint a harrowing picture of the realities of war, where individuals were forcibly recruited into conflicts they had little stake in. The trauma endured on the battlefield reverberated long after the guns fell silent, manifesting in nightmares, psychological distress, and an inability to reintegrate into civilian life as the following quote documents: ""Her husband Stanley was forcibly recruited into the ranks of Britain’s colonial army and returned from service deeply traumatized by the horrors of combat. ‘He came back unwell,’ she says. ‘At night we couldn’t sleep." (Losh)

Why do you think colonial subjects of color have not received more official and popular acknowledgment of their service and sacrifices?

Despite their sacrifices, colonial subjects of color have often been overlooked in official narratives and popular acknowledgment of the war effort. The neglect of soldiers like Stanley, demonstrates a pattern of disregard for their contributions. I believe the neglect may stem from the inherent philosophy used by the empires on their colonialism, where the colonies were primarily seen as sources of exploitation and subjugation rather than as integral parts of the empire. Therefore given the loss of colonial grip in the aftermath of the World War II. As cold, at it may sound, It may have diminished the incentive for colonial powers to acknowledge the service and sacrifices of their colonial subjects.
