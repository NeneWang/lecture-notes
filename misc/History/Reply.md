	- If the objective was to educate given assuming that the white race has a moral obligation and superiority thus obligation to educate the other races. 
	- But our actions doesn't reflect that, perhaps we are educating them, but not on a higher morality.
	- We are not investing in their education, We are cruel, trade them as slaves.
	- Only incentivizing them to be more cruel and unmoral we teach them to burn, intimidate, abuse, leech from honest farmers. We are teaching them the worst of humanity.
- While there is hostility and it makes sense logistically for our ships to have friendly outposts for our ships what we have is not helping and is currently unsustainable
	- We are making enemies by breaking trust, breaking contracts, pursuing unfair trading's and breaking contractual promises
	- This will only create more distrust by the current lack of morality in our way to conduct and the misaligned incentives that we provide.
- While is true that wouldn't make sense to leave them as they are financial and resource assets for your majesty, at the current rate is most likely for them to leave us.
