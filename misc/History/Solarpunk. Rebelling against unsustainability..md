**signment guide and Zoom info for the week of May 6-10:** “1.5 to stay alive:” the unsustainable modern world

Start by reading this guide carefully. Then listen to my podcast episode “’1.5 to stay alive’: The Unsustainable Modern World” (episode 18, https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/steven-remy/episodes/1-5-to-stay-alive-the-unsustainable-modern-world-em9l68). Then read and watch the assignments (see the syllabus for more information).

If there is anything history can teach us about the present and the future it is this: a changing climate is altering every aspect of human society and the world as we know it now is unsustainable.

What has made it unsustainable is the reality of human generated climate change. As James Hansen, one of the world’s most respected climate scientists, pointed out in a 2012 TED Talk, “the science is clear:” human activity has changed and is changing the climate in ways we can only partly predict and may soon be unable to control.

For this week, I’ve asked you to watch Hansen’s TED talk, read a lecture given in 2016 by the writer and activist Naomi Klein, and a lecture by the British-Israeli architect Eyal Weizman. If these sources share a common theme, it is the interconnectedness of the natural and human worlds in the past, present, and future.

**As you read and watch, keep these questions in mind:**

1. What does Klein mean by “green colonialism?”

2. Klein calls attention to the way the late scholar Edward Said used the Arabic term “sumud (‘to stay put, to hold on’)” in his writings about the fate of Palestinians. How does Klein think the term applies beyond Israel-Palestine?

3. What does Klein mean by “othering?”

4. What does she mean by “sacrifice zones?”

5. What is the relationship between the “aridity line,” conflict, and refugees?

6. What does the term “1.5 to stay alive” mean?

7. Eyal Weizman argues that “climate change [is] a project of colonialism … a project of history.” What does he mean by this?

8. Scientists don’t usually become political activists and do things like get themselves arrested in front of the White House. Why did James Hansen do just that?

9. What is the effect of adding CO2 (carbon dioxide) to earth’s atmosphere?

10. What does Hansen assert will be the effect(s) of a warming earth? What does he propose as a solution?

**This week’s assignment (the last one!)**

Armed conflict has always involved the non-human world, with damage to the environment (including what scholars refer to as “environmental infrastructure,” meaning human-engineered or human-cultivated production of natural resources like timber or pastureland, food, potable water, dams, dikes, and canals, and fuel) as the principal result.

But it has only been in relatively recent years that some governments, international organizations (notably the United Nations), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), journalists, and scholars have recognized human-generated climate change as the source of a growing number of violent conflicts around the world. Naomi Klein and Eyal Weizman point to this link in their respective lectures. Observers – such as the diplomat Andrew Harper, who was appointed the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees’ Special Advisor on Climate Action in 2019 – have noted that this connection is usually an indirect one.

In this assignment, I want you to you identify a recent (in roughly the last decade or two) violent conflict somewhere in the world in which the causes can be traced – directly or indirectly - to climate change. In a **600-700** word essay, _briefly_ summarize the conflict _and_ describe how climate change was the principal causal factor.

As in the previous assignment, this one will require you to do some research beyond what I’ve assigned in this class. Use at least three different sources and attach a list of them and any others you used to your essay. Email your completed essay to me no later than **Friday, May 10**.

No more than 10% (50 to 70 words) of your essay may be comprised of direct quotations from your sources.

Organize your essay into paragraphs. Lengthy introductions and/or conclusions are not necessary.
