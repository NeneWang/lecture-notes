After the war, he was repatriated not to Kenya but instead to the Somali region of Ethiopia – with no means to get home."
In another quote, it is described how an African veteran remained so traumatized that he became unable to function regularly
"Her husband Stanley was forcibly recruited into the ranks of Britain’s colonial army and returned from service deeply traumatized by the horrors of combat. ‘He came back unwell,’ she says. ‘At night we couldn’t sleep."

Perhaps the soldiers were thought as an "foreign resource" rather than a true member of the empire thus, not being recognized
