Dear Prime Minister, upon reading your reasoning and claims I will refer to my open letter as my argument to state that the current affairs don't reflect the interest outlined. Given your stated claim that the superior race has a moral duty to civilize the lesser races, it becomes imperative to scrutinize the execution of this mandate. The advocated mandate was to educate and uplift the civilizations and populations we integrate into our domain. However, the reality of the practice of this doctrine has diverged from its stated ideals. Far from elevating these people in moral stature, our actions have been corrupting to civil morality. As stated in my open letter, highlighted in charge TWO, FOURTH, FIFTH, SIXTH, EIGHT, NINTH, ELEVEN, TWELFTH it seems that we are but exporting and educating into corrupting values and engaging in unnecessary cruelty and exports of unmoral actions that destroy the colonies we claim to enrich.  This is evident by the inflicted cruelty, engaged in slave trading, and inculcated and instigating them to commit acts of violence, intimidation, abuse, and exploitation against honest and hardworking individuals. Thus, we seem to fail to the contribution to moral degradation.

I understand the strategic necessity of establishing friendly outposts to facilitate naval logistics and operations. But I can assure you that the current trajectory caused by our actions will undermine the trade and diplomatic outreach of our outposts. A flagrant breach of trust, violation of contracts, and pursuit of inequitable and anticompetitive trade practices stipulated in charge THREE and SEVENTH, which failure to uphold promises, has and will sow seeds of enmity and mistrust to our merchants and leave a sour taste to our diplomatic neighbors. This erosion of moral integrity in our dealings with perverse incentives.

It is undeniable that abandoning these territories would entail a significant loss of financial and strategic assets to our Majesty. However, the trajectory we are on suggests that it is we who are at risk of being abandoned and potentially by force by them. Our mistreatments will slowly culminate in mass insubordination as we lack the forces and manpower to cover the vast surface and population we are assuming responsibility for. The current political and legal model is unsustainable; a fundamental reevaluation of our approach is urgently required to how we apply our laws and how our officers are selected and trained. We must abandon the unproductive treatments of our subjects as inferior and unfertile as stipulated in Charge TWELFTH and instead genuinely invest in and nurture these peoples in the ways of European dignity, utility, and fruits of labor.
