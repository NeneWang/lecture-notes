    "To make your content interactive without requiring readers to leave the current page, you can use a project called [Thebe](https://github.com/executablebooks/thebe).\n",
    "This provides you with a {guilabel}`Live Code` button that, when clicked, will convert each code cell into an **interactive** cell that can be edited.\n",
    "It also adds a \"run\" button to each cell, and connects to a Binder kernel running in the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "To add a Thebe button to your Jupyter Book pages, take these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, [add the common launch button configuration](launchbuttons/configuration). This makes it possible for `thebe/` to use the correct environment and file paths for your content.\n",
    "2. Activate Thebe integration with the following configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```yaml\n",
    "   launch_buttons:\n",
    "     thebe                  : true\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Configure Thebe\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you can configure the Binder settings that are used to provide a kernel for Thebe to run the code.\n",
    "These use the same configuration fields as the BinderHub interact buttons described above.\n",
    "For information about how to do this, see [the BinderHub launch button documentation](launchbuttons/binder)."

    "This is possible by using **cell tags** for the Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding the tag {guilabel}`thebe-init` to any code cell will cause Thebe to run this cell after it has received a kernel.\n",
    "Any subsequent Thebe cells will have access to the same environment (e.g. any module imports made in the initialization cell).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then pair this with something like {guilabel}`hide-input` in order to run initialization code that your user doesn't immediately see.\n",
