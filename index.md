### Practice Booklets

Create one for:

Language Mastery: C++, C#, Javascript, Swift, etc.

Data Science: Data Wrangling, Pandas, Exploration, NLP, etc

Maths: Math problems etc, although , they should have a step to step process for each. Also sets of algorithms and what not: This can be entirely done either creating my own flashcards engine. Or prototyping the idea in Anki.

Same engine could be used for Business math, etc (For now linking to Anki Web is a sastifactory solution)
