    "# The Nurse Scheduling Problem\n",

    "Imagine you are responsible for scheduling the shifts for the nurses in your hospital\n",
    "department for this week. There are three shifts in a day – morning, afternoon, and night –\n",
    "and for each shift, you need to assign one or more of the eight nurses that work in your\n",
    "department. If this sounds like a simple task, take a look at the list of relevant hospital\n",
    "rules:\n",
    "- A nurse is not allowed to work two consecutive shifts.\n",
    "- A nurse is not allowed to work more than five shifts per week.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of nurses per shift in your department should fall within the following limits:\n",
    "- Morning shift: 2–3 nurses\n",
    "- Afternoon shift: 2–4 nurses\n",
    "- Night shift: 1–2 nurses\n",
    "\n",
    "- In addition, each nurse can have shift preferences. For example, one nurse prefers to only\n",
    "work morning shifts, another nurse prefers to not work afternoon shifts, and so on.\n",
    "This task is an example of the nurse scheduling problem (NSP), which can have many\n",
    "variants. Possible variations may include different specialties for different nurses, the\n",
    "ability to work on cover shifts (overtime), or even different types of shifts – such as 8-hour\n",
    "shifts and 12-hour shifts.\n",
    "- By now, it probably looks like a good idea to write a program that will do the scheduling\n",
    "for you. Why not apply our knowledge of genetic algorithms to implement such a\n",
    "program? As usual, we will start by representing the solution to the problem\n",
