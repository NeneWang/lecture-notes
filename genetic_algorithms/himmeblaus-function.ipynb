    "Himmelblau's function is another famous mathematical function used as a benchmark problem in optimization. It's named after David Mautner Himmelblau, who introduced it in 1972. The function is defined as follows:\n",

    "Let's break it down:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The Structure**: Himmelblau's function is made up of two polynomial terms, each squared and added together.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The Variables**: The function depends on two variables, \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), which represent coordinates on a 2D plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The Squares**: Each term in the function is squared. Squaring ensures that all parts of the function are positive, which can create multiple local minima and maxima.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **The Constants**: The numbers 11 and 7 in the function are constants.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **The Summation**: The squared terms are added together to form a single value, which represents the height of the function's surface at a given point \\( (x,y) \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **The Objective**: The goal is to find the minimum value of the function, which corresponds to the lowest point on its surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Himmelblau's function is particularly interesting because it has four identical local minima, each with a value of 0, and one global minimum also at 0. These minima are located at the points:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "(3, 2), \\ (-2.805118, 3.131312), \\ (-3.779310, -3.283186), \\ \\text{and} \\ (3.584428, -1.848126)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These points are like valleys in the landscape represented by the function, and finding them can be challenging due to the function's complex structure with multiple hills and valleys.\n",
    "\n",
    "In optimization, scientists and engineers use Himmelblau's function to test and compare different optimization algorithms. The efficiency of an algorithm is measured by how quickly and accurately it can find the global minimum (the lowest point) of the function. If an algorithm can efficiently navigate the landscape of Himmelblau's function to find the minima, it's likely to perform well on other optimization problems too.\n"
