    "The eggholder function is a mathematical function often used as a benchmark problem for optimization algorithms. It's designed to be challenging due to its complex landscape with multiple local minima and one global minimum. The function is defined as:\n",

    "```{math}\n",
    "f(x,y) = -(y + 47) \\sin\\left(\\sqrt{\\left| \\frac{x}{2} + (y + 47) \\right|}\\right) - x \\sin\\left(\\sqrt{\\left| x - (y + 47) \\right|}\\right)\n",

    "The function has a global minimum at \\( f(512, 404.2319) = -959.6407 \\), which is surrounded by several local minima and maxima. The \"eggholder\" name comes from the visual appearance of the function's plot, which somewhat resembles an egg holder.\n",

    "Imagine you're trying to find the lowest point on a hilly landscape, but there are many hills and valleys, and you can't see the whole picture at once. The eggholder function is like a mathematical version of this situation. It's used to test how well different methods, like optimization algorithms, can find the lowest point (the global minimum) in a complicated landscape with lots of ups and downs.\n",

    "In high school, you might have learned about functions and how to find their minimum or maximum points. The eggholder function is special because it's quite tricky. It has many peaks and valleys, and finding the lowest point isn't easy. So, mathematicians and computer scientists use it to test new methods or algorithms for finding the best solution in complex situations.\n"

    "### Himmelblau's function\n",
    "\n",
    "Himmelblau's function is another famous mathematical function used as a benchmark problem in optimization. It's named after David Mautner Himmelblau, who introduced it in 1972. The function is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "f(x,y) = (x^2 + y - 11)^2 + (x + y^2 - 7)^2 \n",
    "```\n",
    "Let's break it down:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The Structure**: Himmelblau's function is made up of two polynomial terms, each squared and added together.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The Variables**: The function depends on two variables, \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), which represent coordinates on a 2D plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The Squares**: Each term in the function is squared. Squaring ensures that all parts of the function are positive, which can create multiple local minima and maxima.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **The Constants**: The numbers 11 and 7 in the function are constants.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **The Summation**: The squared terms are added together to form a single value, which represents the height of the function's surface at a given point \\( (x,y) \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **The Objective**: The goal is to find the minimum value of the function, which corresponds to the lowest point on its surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Himmelblau's function is particularly interesting because it has four identical local minima, each with a value of 0, and one global minimum also at 0. These minima are located at the points:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "(3, 2), \\ (-2.805118, 3.131312), \\ (-3.779310, -3.283186), \\ \\text{and} \\ (3.584428, -1.848126)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These points are like valleys in the landscape represented by the function, and finding them can be challenging due to the function's complex structure with multiple hills and valleys.\n",
    "\n",
    "In optimization, scientists and engineers use Himmelblau's function to test and compare different optimization algorithms. The efficiency of an algorithm is measured by how quickly and accurately it can find the global minimum (the lowest point) of the function. If an algorithm can efficiently navigate the landscape of Himmelblau's function to find the minima, it's likely to perform well on other optimization problems too.\n",
